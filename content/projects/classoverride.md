# ClassOverride — *extended learning behavior* 🐾

> **BL4CK4T drop:** *ClassOverride engaged. Override the ordinary class. Teach curiosity. Practice ethics. Learn in public.*

## The Details

<img src="https://bl4ck4t.com/script-kitties-crowd.jpg" style="float:left" width="250" alt="the script kitties blending into the crowd"> **ClassOverride** is a teaching repo with Script Kitties vibes—short, hands‑on labs and notebooks that introduce teens to the **hacker mindset** (ethics first, curiosity always). Each folder reads like a BL4CK4T “drop” you can open in Jupyter/Colab and run immediately.

The project’s purpose is simple: help students learn by **doing**—from ciphers and key exchange to network recon and web‑app defense—while pairing every activity with reflection prompts about responsibility and real‑world impact.

## The Features

- **Drop‑based structure (6 arcs)**  
  1) **1 – c0d3_br34k3rs** → cryptography starters (Caesar→frequency analysis, DH key exchange, toy RSA, hybrid crypto demos).  
  2) **2 – n3xt.w33k.1ts.th3.fr13s** → compound‑interest + frugality labs with career presets (admin, electrician, nurse, pharmacist, software, teacher, etc.).  
  3) **3 – pApEr^m8** → adversarial prompt evolution (generate → detect → refine) with saved artifacts for classroom discussion.  
  4) **4 – shAll+wE+plAy+A+gAmE** → Wargames‑style exercises and notes (safe, classroom‑friendly scenarios).  
  5) **5 – Nm4P** → network recon with Nmap: host discovery, service enumeration, challenge modes.  
  6) **6 – 1t‑h4s‑thE‑ju1cE** → OWASP Top‑10 with Juice Shop mapping and guided fixes.

- **Notebook‑first delivery**  
  100% Jupyter Notebook content for projector‑and‑go lessons. Inputs are editable; results are reproducible.

- **Ethics embedded**  
  Every lab frames *why* and *when* to use a skill. Students practice disclosure‑safe language, consent boundaries, and “defend‑first” habits.

- **Teacher‑friendly**  
  Lightweight setup, copyable cells, and clear sectioning (GOAL → STEPS → CHECK → REFLECT).

- **BL4CK4T flavor**  
  Lesson intros use short “drops” and neon‑terminal cues. Feel free to sprinkle in Script Kitties episodes for story‑based hooks.

## The Future

- **More drops** expect more fun labs to drop in the future.  
- **Scenario chains** that link multiple drops (e.g., Nmap → Juice Shop → crypto fixes).

**Run the labs:** clone the repo, open a notebook, and follow the prompts.  
**Remember the ethos:** learn, help, defend. *ClassOverride complete.*
