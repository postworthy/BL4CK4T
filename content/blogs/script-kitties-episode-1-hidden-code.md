# 🐾 Pilot Episode: The Hidden Code

<img src="https://bl4ck4t.com/script-kitties-crowd.jpg" style="float: left;margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" width="250" alt="the script kitties blending into the crowd"> The city of **Cybertropolis** never truly slept. Neon signs flickered across steel towers, and data streams flowed like glowing rivers through the dark alleys. Somewhere high above, in an unseen lair, a message was being written — one that would change everything for the young hacker crew known as the **Script Kitties**.

## The Drop

“New message,” purred **Pixel**, the smallest of the Script Kitties, his bright orange hoodie glowing under the dim light of their hideout.

The rest of the crew crowded around the flickering screen — **Grimalkin**, **Byte**, **Whiskers**, **Cipher**, **Jinx**, and **Shadow**. They lived together in a warehouse converted into a hacker’s den — walls stacked with old servers, neon wires snaking across the ceiling like vines.

The message arrived as a block of strange letters:

```
YMNX NX F YJXY KTW F SJB FIAJSYZWJ
```

Underneath was a pawprint logo — the unmistakable mark of their secret leader: **BL4CK4T**.

“Looks like gibberish,” muttered **Cipher**, the codebreaker in the purple hoodie. “But nothing BL4CK4T sends is random.”

**Whiskers**, the field leader, tapped the screen. “It’s a code. The question is: what kind?”

## The Lesson Begins

The Script Kitties were no strangers to puzzles, but this one felt different. BL4CK4T had promised that their training would come in the form of adventures — and this was clearly the first test.

Cipher leaned forward. “This looks like a **Caesar cipher**. Old-school encryption. You take the alphabet and shift it by a certain number of places. So an **A** might become a **D**, a **B** an **E**, and so on.”

Pixel frowned. “So all we need to do is figure out how far the letters have been shifted?”

“Exactly,” Cipher said. “It’s simple…but don’t be fooled. Even the simplest ciphers can hide big secrets.”

## Trial and Error

The Kitties split up. **Byte**, the blue-hooded gadgeteer, fired up an old terminal. Letters spilled across the screen as he tested different shifts.

“Shift by 1… no good. Shift by 2… still nonsense.”

Pixel scribbled letters on a whiteboard, tail twitching in concentration. “Shift by 5… wait, that looks like words!”

The message began to reveal itself:

```
THIS IS A TEST FOR A NEW ADVENTURE
```

Whiskers grinned, baring sharp teeth. “We cracked it! Classic Caesar cipher with a shift of five.”

The screen flickered again, and new text appeared beneath their solution:

> **Good work, Script Kitties. You’ve proven you can see beyond the obvious.  
> But this is only the beginning.  
> Soon, you will learn how to share secrets in plain sight, even in a city full of spies.  
> Watch for my next drop — it will teach you about keys that lock and unlock.  
> – BL4CK4T**

## Closing Scene

As the neon glow spilled through the cracked windows of their hideout, the Script Kitties pulled their hoodies tight and got to work. The Caesar cipher had been their first test, a way to prove they could think like code-breakers.

But now, BL4CK4T was hinting at something deeper — a way to keep secrets not with just one key, but two.

Rumors swirled across Cybertropolis about villains who prowled the data streams, waiting to strike. But for now, the Kitties’ task was clear: prepare for the **next lesson**.

Above the skyline, a faint message shimmered across a billboard:

**“LOCKS AND KEYS ARE COMING.”**

## ✨ Teaching Tie-In

- **Concept:** *Caesar cipher (shift cipher).*  
- **How it works:** Shift each letter by a fixed number around the alphabet.  
- **Example used:** Plaintext → `THIS IS A TEST FOR A NEW ADVENTURE`; Shift +5 → `YMNX NX F YJXY KTW F SJB FIAJSYZWJ`.  
- **Skills reinforced:** pattern spotting, trial-and-error, teamwork, verifying results.  
- **Next up:** public/private keys & Diffie–Hellman key exchange.
