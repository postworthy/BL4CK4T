# 🐾 Keys to the City: Public–Private Crypto

The neon glow of Cybertropolis hummed as the Script Kitties gathered on a rooftop. A faint pawprint shimmered on a nearby billboard—BL4CK4T’s latest drop.

## The Drop

> “Two strangers meet in the open and walk away with a secret no one else can guess. Learn their trick, and the city stays safe.”

The message flickered, then dissolved into the night. Grimalkin narrowed his eyes. “Sounds like key exchange.” Cipher’s purple hoodie gleamed in the neon as she nodded. “This is about public–private cryptography.”

## The Lesson Begins

**Public–Private Cryptography:** A system where one key locks (encrypts) and another different key unlocks (decrypts).

**Analogy:** Imagine a mailbox. Anyone can slip letters in because the slot is open (the *public key*). But only the person with the mailbox key (the *private key*) can open it and read the letters.

**Minimal steps:**
1. Create a matching public and private key pair.
2. Share the public key with the world.
3. Keep the private key hidden and secure.
4. Anyone can encrypt with the public key, but only you can decrypt with the private key.
5. You can also “sign” with the private key, and anyone can verify with the public key.

**Why it matters:** This is the backbone of secure communication on the web—without it, HTTPS, digital signatures, and secure logins would collapse.

## Trial and Error

Pixel bounced on his heels. “Let’s try Diffie–Hellman first!” He sketched colors in chalk on the rooftop. “We each mix our private paint with the same base color. Then we swap and mix again. Presto—shared secret!”

Byte tapped on his tablet, spinning up code to simulate RSA. “I’ll make a tiny demo. Two small primes, one modulus—boom, public and private keys.”

Cipher checked the math carefully. “Encrypt a message with the public key.” She tossed a neon sticker across the roof. “Now decrypt it with the private one.” The message revealed itself: **STAY CURIOUS.**

Grimalkin double-checked. “If anyone intercepts the first sticker, they can’t decode it without the private key.”

Whiskers nodded. “And if Cipher signs a message with her private key, we all can verify it’s really from her using her public key. Trust, proven.”

Shadow smirked from the shadows. “No fake whispers tonight.”

## Closing Scene

The encrypted billboard shimmered again, the pawprint fading into the night. The Kitties smiled. They had learned how secrets could be safely shared even in plain sight.

Pixel stretched. “Keys that work in pairs—like us.”

Grimalkin added, “One to protect, one to prove. Balance.”

And together, the Script Kitties disappeared into the neon maze, carrying the keys to the city’s trust.
